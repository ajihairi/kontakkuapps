üö´ Standard Compliant
js-standard-style This project adheres to Standard. Our CI enforces this, so we suggest you enable linting to keep your project compliant during development.

To Lint on Commit

This is implemented using husky. There is no additional setup needed.

Bypass Lint

If you have to bypass lint for a special commit that you will come back and clean (pushing something to a branch etc.) then you can bypass git hooks with adding --no-verify to your commit command.

Understanding Linting Errors

The linting rules are from JS Standard and React-Standard. Regular JS errors can be found with descriptions here, while React errors and descriptions can be found here.
